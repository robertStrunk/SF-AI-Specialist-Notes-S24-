[Video Overview](https://salesforce.vidyard.com/watch/Kw7DfNqG7AGPAZcqrrn2T5)

The Einstein Trust Layer is a security and governance framework in Salesforce that ensures the responsible, ethical, and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the platform's products, especially those powered by Salesforce Einstein (Salesforce’s AI technology). It acts as a safeguard to build trust in the AI-powered features by protecting data privacy, enforcing ethical AI practices, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

## Zero-Data Retention Policy
Your data isn’t retained by third-party LLMs. We partner with Open AI and Azure Open AI to enforce the zero-data retention policy.

- No data is used for LLM model training or product improvements by third-party LLMs.
- No data is retained by the third-party LLMs.
- No human being at the third-party provider looks at data sent to their LLM.

## Dynamic Grounding with Secure Data Retrieval
- Relevant information from a Salesforce record is merged with the prompt to provide context.
- Secure data retrieval of Salesforce data for grounding the prompt based on the permissions of the user executing the prompt.
- Secure data retrieval preserves in place all standard Salesforce role-based controls for user permissions and field-level security when merging grounding data from your CRM instance or Data Cloud.

## Prompt Defense
- System policies help limit hallucinations and decrease the likelihood of unintended or harmful outputs by the LLM.
- System policies can vary for different generative AI features and use cases.

## Data Masking
- Sensitive data is detected and masked before sending the prompt to the LLM.
- Data masking supports multiple regions and languages.
- You can select what must and must not be masked.

## Toxicity Scoring
- Einstein Trust Layer scores content on toxicity.
- Toxicity scores are logged and stored in Data Cloud as part of the audit trail.

## Audit
- Prompts, responses, and trust signals are logged and stored in Data Cloud.
- Feedback can be used for improving prompt templates.
- Provides pre-built reports and dashboards for analysis.

## Key Takeaways of the Trust Layer:
1. It prevents LLMs from seeing sensitive data.
2. It prohibits LLMs and providers from monitoring or retaining your data.
3. It helps you monitor content for safety.
