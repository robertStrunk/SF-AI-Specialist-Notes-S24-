# Salesforce Certified AI Specialist (Summer 24)

### Exam Topic
Identify the security, privacy, and grounding features of the Einstein Trust Layer

### Key Concepts
1. **Data Governance**: The Einstein trust layer is the "Watchdog" of the data. Any models or apps that reach for the data have to go through the trust layer. 
2. **Dynamic Grounding**: The injection/binding of customer data into a prompt before it is sent to the LLM.
3. **Data Masking**: The obfuscation of sensitive data after it is grounded to the prompt before it is sent to the LLM.
4. **Data Demasking**: The reverse of data masking. Once the LLM responds, this process puts the sensitive data back so that the end user has a seamless experience.
5. **Zero Data Retention**: After the LLM has processed a prompt, and data referenced won't be stored by the LLM provider.
6. **Toxicity Detection**: After a response is returned from an LLM, the Salesforce Trust Layer assigns a toxicity score to the response. 

### Key Mechanisms
1. **Einstein Trust Layer**: Setup > Einstein > Einstein Generative AI > Einstein Trust Layer
2. **Einstein Feedback**: Setup > Einstein > Einstein Generative AI > Einstein Feeback

### Details

The Einstein Trust Layer is a security and governance framework in Salesforce that ensures the responsible, ethical, and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the platform's products, especially those powered by Salesforce Einstein (Salesforceâ€™s AI technology). It acts as a safeguard to build trust in the AI-powered features by protecting data privacy, enforcing ethical AI practices, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

Via the Einstein Feedback tool, you can audit/monitor request and response information. 

Super important takeaways of the trust layer:
1. It prevents LLMs from seeing sensitive data.
2. It prohibits LLMs and providers from monitoring or retaining your data.
3. It helps you monitor content for safety.
